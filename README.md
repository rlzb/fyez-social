Cybernetic Website
A futuristic cyberpunk-themed website with a green matrix vibe, featuring 5 pages filled with interactive animations, digital effects, and a Matrix-like design.

Features
Five Pages: Each page has unique content and a consistent cybernetic design, with a Matrix-style animation and text effects in green.

Snow Effect: A subtle snow effect across all pages, adding to the cyberpunk atmosphere.

Binary Computer Page: One of the pages contains an interactive binary computer visualized with 1s and 0s, simulating the look of a machine processing information.

Green Text Animations: Text elements across the site are animated in a futuristic, cybernetic style, showing numbers and symbols as part of the design.

Responsive Design: The website is designed to look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML: To structure the content across the five pages.

CSS: To create the styling, animations, and overall design of the site, including the Matrix-like effects.

JavaScript (Optional): Used to add interactive elements and advanced animations (if needed in the future).
